## Development Notes

### File Organization

- All three.js related files are now organized in the `threejs/` folder for better maintainability
- Core website functionality remains in the root directory
- Vendor libraries are kept in the `vendor/` folder

## Getting Started

1. **Local Development**: Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser
2. **Web Server**: For full functionality, serve the files through a web server (due to CORS restrictions with fonts)
3. **WebGL**: Ensure your browser supports WebGL for the three.js animation
